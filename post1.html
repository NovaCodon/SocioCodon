    <h3>Why we discontinued Severe Techno</h3>
<p>First of all Happy Diwali to everyone! This is our first ever post on SocioCodon</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Severe Techno faced vandalism on many wiki platforms.</li>
      <li>Multiple accounts used the same name and icon, making unnecessary edits.</li>
      <li>These accounts were blocked by those platforms for long periods.</li>
      <li>My Instagram account was hacked, raising concerns about potential misuse.</li>
      <li>To avoid these issues, I decided to stop Severe Techno and continue under a new name.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why we “Gaslighted” the name Neera Yahlium</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I initially created the Neera Yahlium IDE in Python 2.7, presenting it as if it had existed since 2011.</li>
      <li>The goal was to make people believe the business was older than it actually was.</li>
      <li>Later, I realized lying about the origin was unnecessary.</li>
      <li>I quietly removed all references to Neera Yahlium and renamed it to NeuroYott, suggesting Severe Techno was directly renamed to NeuroYott.</li>
      <li>Eventually, I decided to use a name I had previously used in 2023 for a new channel: NovaCodon.</li>
      <li>On Sep 1, 2025, NovaCodon was rebranded to align with the original branding and eliminate the old short form “NY.”</li>
    </ul>
