    <p>The Indian rupee symbol (₹) has a fascinating history, but has many myths surround its adoption, designing, early usage and for selection. Here’s the accurate timeline, clarifying what actually happened:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Early 2009 – Designing the Symbol</strong><br>– The ₹ symbol was designed by Dr. Udaya Kumar in early 2009.<br>– <em>Myth busted:</em> Some sources mistakenly claim the design was made in 2010. The actual design existed well before the official selection. Some say that the Rupee Symbol competition of 2010, but the fact is that this competition was started and ended on 5 March 2009 and 15 April 2009, which lie in 2009 itself, only the result declaration was in 2010.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>15 July 2010 – Selection as the Winner</strong><br>– The symbol was officially selected as the winning design from among numerous entries. At that time and until 12 October it was not usable even government did not use it, same for the citizens of the country.<br>– On this day, Finance Ministry officials announced:<br><br>
      “The symbol <b>will be adopted in a span of six months in the country, and within 18 to 24 months globally</b>, Soni said, adding that it will feature on computer keyboards and software for worldwide use.”<br><br>
      – <em>Myth busted:</em> Many assume that the symbol was officially adopted on 15 July 2010. <br>– Fact: Selection is different from adoption; the symbol was only chosen at this point.<br><br>It was not even possible to use it at that time. And even the Finance Ministry never said that today we are adopting the Rupee symbol rather it was said it will be adopted within 6 months in the country as mentioned earlier.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>12 October 2010 – Real Adoption & Official Use</strong><br>– Unicode 6.0 was officially released on October 11, 2010 (PT), and got available in India on <b>12 October 2010</b> due to a different time zone(UTC+5:30). This included emojis for the first time and also the ₹ symbol with the code point U+20B9. Before this date either "Rs." or ₨ (U+20A8) was used for both handwritten and printed/digital copies. Because of the Unicode standardisation, the traditional “Rs.” was started to be replaced with the newly encoded “₹” in government documents, banks, CBSE’s reprinted NCERT Books (when the previous stock finished), and utility bills.<br>– This marks the first real, practical <b>de facto</b> adoption of the rupee symbol in India, and marks the starting of usage in the government documents. <b>Though still "Rs." was used more widely even after this date, but from this day onwards, it actually became possible for anyone to use the rupee symbol, which was not possible earlier, marking true adoption both in the digital world by the Unicode Standardisation as well as in the country. This also made the symbol get adopted internationally also due to the Unicode Standardisation. </b><br>– <em>Myth busted:</em> Selection date is sometimes <b>wrongly</b> cited as the adoption date; the true adoption date is 12 October 2010.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>8 July 2011 – Adoption on the Physical Currency</strong><br>– The symbol appeared for the first time on Indian coins, when they were introduced. Until around <b>November 2010</b> the old the 50 paise Hasta Mudra Series and Common Circulation Series coins <b>without</b> the Rupee sign were minted. The ₹1 and ₹2 Hasta Mudra Series coins (the coins without the ₹ symbol) were minted until early 2011.<br><br>Until 30 June 2011, all coins of 25 paise and below (from 1 paise to 25 paise) were legal tender. They ceased to be legal tender on <b>1 July 2011</b>, effectively discontinuing the paisa currency. Technically an old 1 paise from 1970s could be used until 2011 though it was stopped to be circulated from 1979. Paise coins never used the ₹ symbol because they lost legal tender status before the symbol was introduced on rupee coins. It is possible that the paisa currency were discontinued for this reason, as the RBI may not have wanted to incorporate the symbol on paise coins. However, the paisa was still a different unit of currency from the rupee. This was the first time when the new rupee symbol was used on the currency.<br>– <em>Myth busted:</em> Many believe it appeared immediately on all currency from July 2010 itself; but it was first included on coins only and that in July 2011 not 2010, July 2010 is not even the adoption date. In 2011 itself the new banknotes with ₹ was started to be incorporated into banknotes, but all notes were introduced in different dates like:<br>1. ₹10 note: 23 September 2011<br>2. ₹20 and ₹50 notes: 12 April 2012<br>1. ₹500 note: 26 December 2011<br>4. ₹1000 note: 18 November 2011<br>The ₹5 note was never printed with the ₹ symbol, and its printing was ceased in 2011 itself.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Kaun Banega Crorepati Season 4 and Early Rupee Symbol Usage – 11 October 2010 – KBC Season 4 Premiere:</strong><br>– The show premiered at 9:10 PM IST.<br>– Initially, the logo still displayed four Rs instead of the ₹ symbol.<br>– After the first break of the premiere episode (around 9:30PM IST), the logo was updated to display six ₹ symbols. The logo on the wall also appeared for the first time as the logo on the video wall that appeared after the short ad break around 9:30PM IST was already pre-recorded, the rupee signs were images rather than actual text in the logo, since the rupee symbol's winner was announced in July, even though it had not been adopted at the time. This case was similar to the case in France, which is mentioned below.<br><br>
      <em>Fun fact:</em> Cheques signed by Amitabh Bachchan at the start of the season still used the traditional “Rs.” In front of the amount in numerals until many days, as the episodes were recorded earlier.</li>

      <br>– Comparison to France:<br>Similar to France’s quiz show “Qui Veut Gagner Des Millions?” in 2001. France was set to adopt the Euro in January 2002, which was announced in 2001, and the show began displaying and distributing prize amounts in euros in advance, including the Euro symbol, even before the official adoption, in late 2001. Similarly the rupee symbol was announced as the winner in July 2010 KBC Season 4 showcased it in advance, before it got adopted on 12 October 2010.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Summarising the dates:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Design: Early 2009</li>
      <li>Winner Selected: 15 July 2010 (not adoption)</li>
      <li>Digital Adoption and Start of Public and Government Use: 12 October 2010</li>
      <li>Adoption on the Physical currency: 8 July 2011</li>
    </ul>
