In this post we will talk how Google Translate evolved in just three years too rapidly.<div><ol><li>If we see the first image from 18 Oct 2009 (16 years old), the layout look too classic and old with almost no CSS, very old looking UI only one boxed translation and a lot of content. Chrome browser is also very old looking.</li><li>If we come to the second image from 18 Oct 2010 (15 years old), the layout is still too classic but it has reduced a few things The UI is still too minimal and looks still very old. If we come to browser, the main colour has changed from little blueish to a little yellowish, some icons have been updated and the Google logo in front of the context buttons of the title bar has been removed, rest all the browser looks exactly the same, I think these changes would not have been spotted by any normal user.</li><li>If we come to the third image from 18 Dec 2010, it looks little updated, the logo for the first time has changed, this change have took place on 15 Nov 2010, when the Google Apps changed its logo to the new one. The browser looks changed a lot, the UI has become smooth and modern, the browser has significantly changed. This change in browser is due to the Chrome 7.0 update of 19 Oct 2010,which brought this new UI.</li><li>At kast we have a screenshot from 18 Oct 2011 (14 years old), the UI of website has been updated, it now looks modern due to the new CSS in all Google sites which came in June 2011, the translate has two seperate boxes one for input and secon for the output. The browser's icon has changed too. The website still feels old in front of the present day app.</li><li>THIS IS THE POWER OF TIME AND CHANGE!!</li></ol><div><p>
